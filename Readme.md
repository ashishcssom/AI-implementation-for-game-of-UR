## Game🎲 introduction
The game board is split into three sections: 

**Co-ordinate information**
```
            [[(0,2)],[(1,2)],[(2,2)],[(3,2)],[( , )],[( , )],[(6,2)],[(7,2)]] # Player 1
            [[(0,1)],[(1,1)],[(2,1)],[(3,1)],[(4,1)],[(5,1)],[(6,1)],[(7,1)]] # Common path
            [[(0,0)],[(1,0)],[(2,0)],[(3,0)],[( , )],[( , )],[(6,0)],[(7,0)]] # Player 2
```

- Starting safe zone : four squares long  

      [(0,0)],[(1,0)],[(2,0)],[(3,0)]
      [(0,2)],[(1,2)],[(2,2)],[(3,2)]

- Shared combat zone : eight squares long  

      [(0,1)],[(1,1)],[(2,1)],[(3,1)],[(4,1)],[(5,1)],[(6,1)],[(7,1)]

- Ending safe zone   : two square long

      [(6,0)],[(7,0)]
      [(6,2)],[(7,2)]
  
Each player has a `starting safe zone` which is four squares long. Next, there is a `shared combat zone` that is eight squares long, in which pieces can knock opponent's pieces off the board. Finally, there is a `ending safe zone` which is two squares in length followed by the end-zone. Additionally, there are five "rosette"✪ squares on the board: one in each player's starting zone, one in the combat zone, and one in each player's ending zone. When a piece lands on a rosette, the owner of that piece gets another move. Additionally, the rosette in the combat zone serves as another safe zone for whichever piece occupies it and opponent cannot occupy that rosette if it is already occupied by another.
