## Game introduction
The game board is split into three sections: each player has a starting safe zone which is four squares long. Next, there is a shared combat zone that is eight squares long, in which pieces can knock opponent's pieces off the board. Finally, there is a ending safe zone which is two squares in length followed by the end-zone. Additionally, there are five "rosette" squares on the board: one in each player's starting zone, one in the combat zone, and one in each player's ending zone. When a piece lands on a rosette, the owner of that piece gets another move. Additionally, the rosette in the combat zone serves as another safe zone for whichever piece occupies it.
