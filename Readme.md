## Game🎲 introduction
The game board is split into three sections: 

**Co-ordinate information**
```
            [[(0,2)],[(1,2)],[(2,2)],[(3,2)],[( , )],[( , )],[(6,2)],[(7,2)]] # Player 1
            [[(0,1)],[(1,1)],[(2,1)],[(3,1)],[(4,1)],[(5,1)],[(6,1)],[(7,1)]] # Common path
            [[(0,0)],[(1,0)],[(2,0)],[(3,0)],[( , )],[( , )],[(6,0)],[(7,0)]] # Player 2
```

- Starting safe zone : four squares long  

      [(0,0)],[(1,0)],[(2,0)],[(3,0)]
      [(0,2)],[(1,2)],[(2,2)],[(3,2)]

- Shared combat zone : eight squares long  

      [(0,1)],[(1,1)],[(2,1)],[(3,1)],[(4,1)],[(5,1)],[(6,1)],[(7,1)]

- Ending safe zone   : two square long

      [(6,0)],[(7,0)]
      [(6,2)],[(7,2)]
  
Each player has a `starting safe zone` which is four squares long. Next, there is a `shared combat zone` that is eight squares long, in which pieces can knock opponent's pieces off the board. Finally, there is a `ending safe zone` which is two squares in length followed by the end-zone. Additionally, there are five "rosette"✪ squares on the board: one in each player's starting zone, one in the combat zone, and one in each player's ending zone. When a piece lands on a rosette, the owner of that piece gets another move. Additionally, the rosette in the combat zone serves as another safe zone for whichever piece occupies it.
